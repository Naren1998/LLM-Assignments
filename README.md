Assignment Structure:
Unleash the Reviews: Download and load a dataset of music reviews from a public source like Goodreads API or Kaggle's "Amazon Book Reviews" dataset.
Clean and Prepare: Remove irrelevant characters, normalize text (lowercase, etc.), and tokenize each review into a list of words.
Word Frequency Hunt: Use dictionaries or NumPy arrays to count the occurrences of each word in all reviews. Identify the most frequent words and visualize them in a word cloud or bar chart.
Sentiment Detective: Build a simple sentiment analyzer using positive and negative word lists. Calculate an overall sentiment score for each review based on its word usage.
